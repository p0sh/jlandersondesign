		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		
		<p>When the Career section was added to the BigFuture website, the team conducted extensive user research into what students expected to see. This work informed both the information architecture and the user experience, ensuring it met the needs of different types of information seekers; for example, not only the student browsing for ideas but also the student seeking deep information about one selected career.</p>
		
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>To appeal to a diverse range of information seekers and to clearly present as much information as possible, I designed a pattern that functioned like a mini site for each career. Each career profile has an overview page as well as other tabs that lead to more specific information. We partnered with information providers to include brief descriptions, specific income and education ranges, and more for over 450 careers.</p>

			<div class="screenshot">
				<img src="img/ux/BF/BF-careerprofile1-DESK.png" alt="Career profile Overview, desk view"><label>Career profile Overview, desk view</label>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>I also led the UX effort to determine the design pattern for different career card types. On BigFuture.org, search results use a standard card pattern, while mini-cards support lateral navigation in sections like "Similar Careers." I determined the content strategy for the hierarchy of the different card types, and worked closely with our UI designer to evaluate the most useful design for the flow of knowledge.</p>

		</div>

		<h2>Result</h2>
		<p>Launching the career profiles increased BigFuture's focus on the career space. Over about 8 months after launch, there were 7.4 million views to the career profiles. The section also directly drove our K-12 partner contract renewals. Overall the Careers section had 11.3 million user sessions by feature, and 6.75 million user sessions across all features.</p>
		
		<p>By applying user research and thoughtful information architecture, I unified content presentation and improved both user engagement and long-term growth.</p>
