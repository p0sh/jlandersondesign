			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>While working on UI documentation for Infor.com, I recognized a process problem: separate prototypes, design specs, and requirements documents were creating fragmented knowledge flow and misalignment across our teams. To better understand the issue, I surveyed visual designers and front- and back-end developers about their learning styles. This research revealed an opportunity to organize internal knowledge, improve information architecture, and create a unified resource that matched how users actually absorbed information. (In this case, the users were my own teammates.)</p>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>I took on this challenge before more sophisticated prototyping platforms like Figma existed. So, I experimented with contemporary platforms like Sketch, InVision, and UXPin, and developed a process to add requirements notes to the prototypes that were delivered to our development and QA teams.</p>

			<p>I created a reusable pattern in Sketch: a clickable "notes layer" that overlaid requirements directly on top of the prototype, similar to how interactivity hotspots were defined. A simple toggle button allowed developers, QA, and designers to switch instantly between the design and its underlying specifications.</p> 

			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>Teams quickly adopted the new workflow, using InVision's comments and notation features to collaborate directly within the prototype. This shift eliminated the need for multiple documents in meetings, reduced development time by about a week, and cut down on follow-up calls about interactivity.</p>

			<p>By integrating documentation into a single, accessible system, I helped facilitate information delivery, increase alignment, and strengthen trust across teams. I later <a href="https://medium.com/hook-loop/7-reasons-you-should-stop-making-static-wireframes-28a674e5042a">published the process</a> on Infor's Medium channel to make the knowledge even more accessible.</p>
