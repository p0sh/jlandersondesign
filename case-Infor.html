		<h1>Project: Infor User testing pop-up lab</h1>
		<p class="summary">Three days of live research</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>While Infor has a tradition of in-depth user research methods for its product development, there was no process for doing quick, iterative website tests with a large number of users at once. As Infor's first Information Architect, I recognized this gap in how the organization generated research.</p>

			</div>
		
			
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>When planning for Inforum 2016, I proposed and led the creation of Infor's first live user testing lab, a cross-disciplinary initiative that brought customers, executives, and UX practitioners together for three days of structured UX testing. This offered attendees&mdash;both customers and Infor's executives&mdash;a tangible way to participate in and appreciate our user-centered design process.</p>

			<p>I defined the testing framework and organized the workflows for the team running the tests. To extend the impact, I also launched the <a href="http://www.infor.com/company/beta-tester-community/">Beta Tester Community</a>, a scalable quick-testing program that made ongoing feedback more accessible and helped organize internal knowledge across diverse teams.</p>

		</div>

			
			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>During Inforum, we completed 96 tests across five products. Within a year, the Beta Tester Community grew to 480+ participants, enabling continuous feedback that supported more effective patterns and stronger information science practices.

		<h1>Project: UI documentation for Infor.com</h1>
		<p class="summary">More information, fewer documents</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>While working on UI documentation for Infor.com, I recognized a process problem: separate prototypes, design specs, and requirements documents were creating fragmented knowledge flow and misalignment across our teams. To better understand the issue, I surveyed visual designers and front- and back-end developers about their learning styles. This research revealed an opportunity to organize internal knowledge, improve information architecture, and create a unified resource that matched how users actually absorbed information. (In this case, the users were my own teammates.)</p>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>I took on this challenge before more sophisticated prototyping platforms like Figma existed. So, I experimented with contemporary platforms like Sketch, InVision, and UXPin, and developed a process to add requirements notes to the prototypes that were delivered to our development and QA teams.</p>

			<p>I created a reusable pattern in Sketch: a clickable "notes layer" that overlaid requirements directly on top of the prototype, similar to how interactivity hotspots were defined. A simple toggle button allowed developers, QA, and designers to switch instantly between the design and its underlying specifications. (Later, when UXPin added notations to their platform, I experimented with this same concept <a href="demos/UId11n-UXPin/index.html">using their software</a>.)</p>

			<label>Documentation with interactive notes, using InVision</label>
		</div>


			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>Teams quickly adopted the new workflow, using InVision's comments and notation features to collaborate directly within the prototype. This shift eliminated the need for multiple documents in meetings, reduced development time by about a week, and cut down on follow-up calls about interactivity.</p>

			By integrating documentation into a single, accessible system, I helped facilitate information delivery, increase alignment, and strengthen trust across teams. I later <a href="https://medium.com/hook-loop/7-reasons-you-should-stop-making-static-wireframes-28a674e5042a">published the process</a> on Infor's Medium channel to make the knowledge even more accessible.
