		<h1>Project: NYPL "Three Faiths" exhibition</h2>
		<p class="summary">Wireframes as a tool for collaboration</p>


			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Early in my tenure, NYPL's design process centered around presenting stakeholders with fully-polished, high-fidelity visuals. While impressive-looking, this approach limited opportunities for iteration and slowed decision-making. Stakeholders lacked a shared vocabulary and space for cross-disciplinary insight, which made collaboration difficult.</p>
			
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>For the "Three Faiths" online exhibition, I introduced wireframing as a core design thinking practice to foster trust. By using low-fidelity wireframes to clarify intent, evaluate requirements, and guide conversation, I shifted our weekly meetings into efficient working sessions where stakeholders felt more included in shaping the information architecture and design direction.</p>

			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>Stakeholders became partners in an iterative process, developing a sense of ownership and confidence in the design. We achieved a universally approved functional design much faster, and the project set a precedent for a more participatory and user-centered workflow across the department.</p>
