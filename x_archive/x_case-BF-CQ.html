		<h1>BigFuture.org: Career quiz and Interest results</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		
		<p>Through surveys and moderated testing, we came to know that many of our students had no idea what they wanted to do after high school. These students needed to start exploring directions that engaged their real interests: but first we needed to help them identify those interests.</p>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>We partnered with the O*NET Career Exploration Tools to offer a 60 question quiz. The quiz offered a quantification system that avoided grades or classes, thereby evaluating interest areas in a way that felt approachable and supportive.</p>
		
		<p>I led the effort to make the quiz easy to use on both mobile and desktop (a critical challenge given its length). I designed the content before and after the quiz to appropriately set expectations. I documented and refined the error states, ensuring the experience met accessibility and usability needs.</p>

		<p>It was especially important that the results page would encourage quiz takers to act on the results. Together with our UI designer, I created a display unlike anything we had on the site. We used the D3 data visualization JavaScript library to translate the quiz output into a colorful, understandable system of career indicators, which we then followed with personalized recommendations based on those results.</p>

		<h2>Result</h2>
		<p>Over about 8 months after launch, the quiz received 2 million student visitors and an impressive 91.3% completion rate: evidence of a great user experience designed with user empathy. Most completers engaged further by visiting recommended careers or adding careers to their Saved Lists directly from the results page. Overall, the Careers section achieved 11.3 million user sessions by feature, and 6.75 million user sessions across all features.</p>
		
		<p>This work showcased my team's cross-disciplinary collaboration, which delivered a solution shaped by strong process and user research.</p>
