		<h2>Challenge</h2>

College Board reaches more than 7 million students a year, helping them navigate the path from high school to college and career.
ur BigFuture¨ program helps students plan for college, pay for college, and explore careers.
	
		<p>In 2024, BigFuture initiated a strategy to position college majors as a primary engagement pathway. Because students already understand the idea of a major, I wanted to extend that familiarity to not only provide an entry point, but also to offer students a way to contextualize their post-high school plans.</p>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>To build the infrastructure enabling students to navigate the Majors section, we first needed clear user flows grounded in research and evaluation. I identified three core categories of student users: those with a clear plan after high school, those with a partial idea, and those with no idea at all.</p>

		<p>Next, I built personas for each of those three types, and added them to our collection of Figma templates for easy access. Then I created different user flows for each persona depending on a variety of entry points.</p>

			</div>
		</div>		

<p>I used these user flows to facilitate conversation within the team about the connections and patterns between majors and careers, colleges, and scholarships. The clarity gained during these sessions directly guided developer decisions and shaped major improvements to the Majors section, including a searchable directory with type-ahead functionality and a profile page for each major.</p>

			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>These features, along with the inclusion of similar majors and related careers on each major profile, now connect what used to be very separate sections of the site into more easily navigable paths.</p>
			<p>By adding the personas to our Figma template library, I also enabled the full team to easily understand the students we were building for.</p>
