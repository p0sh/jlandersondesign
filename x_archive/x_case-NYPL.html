		<p>During the 8 years that I was Senior UX Designer for the New York Public Library, I helped guide the organization through a pivotal shift toward handheld and personalized digital experiences. By grounding our work in user research and reusable patterns, I helped shape the Library's digital strategy with systems that set a baseline for future iterations and new projects. I built the Library's first design pattern library, I fully redesigned the Support section, and I led the UX side of upgrading the Drupal installation for NYPL.org.</p>

		<h1>Project: NYPLBase design system</h1>
		<p class="summary">NYPL's first rapid prototyping code framework</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The Library's digital ecosystem lacked consistent design documentation, resulting in duplicated work, unclear patterns, and fragmented processes across teams. At the time, design pattern libraries like Bootstrap were just becoming popular, and I wanted the Library's flagship site to have its own package of code that provides NYPL branding, as well as a reference of design patterns.</p>

		</div>

			
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>I designed and built NYPLBase, the Library's first internal design system and rapid-prototyping code framework. I developed the visual styles and object patterns, tested early paper prototypes with internal teams, and built the code base (using InuitCSS as a base) to ensure responsive behavior and ease of reuse. The <a href="http://nypl.github.io/NYPLBase/styleguide/">style guide</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NYPL/NYPLBase">code base</a> are both available on GitHub.</p>

			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>Its first project-based use was in the redesign of the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/locations/">Locations section of NYPL.org</a>. We saved time, tested working code with real patrons, and reused code in much of the design phase. Being able to test real code was essential to our ability to gauge the success of the UX with its target audience during development sprints.</p>

		<h1>Project: NYPL "Three Faiths" exhibition</h2>
		<p class="summary">Wireframes as a tool for collaboration</p>


			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Early in my tenure, NYPL's design process centered around presenting stakeholders with fully-polished, high-fidelity visuals. While impressive-looking, this approach limited opportunities for iteration and slowed decision-making. Stakeholders lacked a shared vocabulary and space for cross-disciplinary insight, which made collaboration difficult.</p>
			
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>For the "Three Faiths" online exhibition, I introduced wireframing as a core design thinking practice to foster trust. By using low-fidelity wireframes to clarify intent, evaluate requirements, and guide conversation, I shifted our weekly meetings into efficient working sessions where stakeholders felt more included in shaping the information architecture and design direction.</p>

			</div>
		</div>

			
			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>Stakeholders became partners in an iterative process, developing a sense of ownership and confidence in the design. We achieved a universally approved functional design much faster, and the project set a precedent for a more participatory and user-centered workflow across the department.</p>

		<h1 class="mult-project-hed">Project: NYPL.org Support section</h2>
		<p class="summary">A strategic redesign on a short timeline</p>
		

		<div class="screenshot">
			<img src="img/ux/NYPL/NYPLSupport.png" alt="NYPL Support section">
			<label>NYPL Support section</label>
		</div>


			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The Development department needed to communicate the many ways patrons could support the Library, but as the sole UX designer, my time was limited. This required a highly efficient approach so that my time with the Development staff needed to be as productive as possible.</p>
			
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>I began by assessing requirements and working with the Development team to define content priorities using structured tools such as page tables. This strategic approach unified stakeholders around a shared purpose and improved organizational insight into what donors truly needed.</p>
			<p>Using wireframes, I quickly tested content and layout hypotheses, ensuring alignment before visual design or code. This process allowed us to make rapid, informed decisions, grounded in sound design principles.</p>
			
			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>Within six months, membership increased by 33%, demonstrating the impact of improved information architecture and user experience. This success led to a follow-up project developing contextual donation "ads" across the site, which increased donations and strengthened the Library's fundraising capacity.</p>
